                <p>
                    Electrical engineering undergrad eager to seek skills and build connections! I pride myself in my curiosity and passion to find the answers to challenging problems, all the while making an impact on those surrounding me. Learning
                    as I go try
                    to accomplish a new task is also something I enjoy. From this, I picked up some knowledge in creating games, programming robots, as well as breadboarding to control a microcontroller. My previous experiences as a volunteer and
                    extracurriculars allowed me to develop crucial skills like communication, teamwork, and leadership. Outside of my academic and professional career, I like to relax and have fun in photography and music. I try to take every
                    opportunity to
                    pursue these creative outlets while balancing it with my rigorous schedule.
